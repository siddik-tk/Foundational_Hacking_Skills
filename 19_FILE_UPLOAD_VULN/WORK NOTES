file upload vulnerability:

lab 1:

just upload a executable file through image upload option

lab 2:
due to restriction only to png and jpeg.we cheats to be the p[hp as jpeg through burp repeater

lab 3:
 location my-account/avatar .file is also uploaded but not executed.
problem: 1.code may have issue .
	 2.location doesnt have execution previleg
overcoming location issue (2)
upload file with ../(better to encode in url format)

it upoaded and while checking the broken image it gives an error

Not Found
The requested URL was not found on this server.
Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) Server at 4f2d429be2d2 Port 80

its because the url cant understand this ../ - its better mov back the file our self

lab 4:
my-account/avatar - same location
php files are not allowed Sorry - seems php exex files are blackliste
it can be bypassed by the apache vulnerability found there by using htaccess file type to set new file type in the server

lab 5:
it whitelist to jpg and png

virus.php.jpg	If server uses pathinfo() and looks at first extension only
.php;.jpg or .php%20.jpg	Bypass weak filters
Content-Type spoofing	Set header: Content-Type: image/jpeg in Burp
Magic byte spoof	Add real JPEG header to a PHP file
.phtml, .php5	Allowed by Apache as PHP
.htaccess override	Make .abc treated as PHP

these are the bypasses...
its simply done by virus.php%00.png

lab 6:
Error: file is not a valid image Sorry, there was an error uploading your file. it gives a idea like they are analysing the whole  image wheteher it is image or not
